= hanzi-converter

Convert Hanzi to pinyin. Unlike other similar gems, this includes tones and can accurately translate common words (others fail at things like 为什么). Uses cc-cedict for data. Does not yet have fallback for individual hanzi not in cedict.

Example usage:

  HanziConverter.load_data
  HanziConverter.to_pinyin('走红') # zou3hong2
  HanziConverter.to_pinyin('簡單') # jian3dan1
  HanziConverter.to_pinyin('为什么') # wei4shen2me5
  HanziConverter.to_pinyin('no! 为什么！') # no! wei4shen2me5！
  HanziConverter.to_pinyin('你好， 我是康昱辰。') # ni3hao3， wo3shi4kang1yu4chen2。

To run tests:

  rake test

== Contributing to hanzi-converter

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
